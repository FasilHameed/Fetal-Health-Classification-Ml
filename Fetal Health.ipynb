    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction of child and maternal mortality is a crucial global health objective outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. By 2030, the UN aims to eliminate preventable deaths among newborns and children under 5 years of age, striving to reduce under-5 mortality to 25 per 1,000 live births worldwide. Additionally, maternal mortality remains a significant concern, with approximately 295,000 deaths occurring during and after pregnancy each year, predominantly in low-resource settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, effective monitoring of fetal health is essential. Cardiotocograms (CTGs) provide a simple and cost-effective means to assess fetal well-being, enabling healthcare professionals to take timely interventions to prevent adverse outcomes for both mother and child. CTG equipment operates by emitting ultrasound pulses and recording responses, thereby capturing crucial indicators such as fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, and uterine contractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comprises 2,126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams. Each record has been meticulously classified into one of three classes by expert obstetricians:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normal\n",
    "2. Suspect\n",
    "3. Pathological\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify CTG exam results into one of the three aforementioned classes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to assist healthcare professionals in early identification of fetal distress and provide timely interventions, thereby contributing to the reduction of child and maternal mortality rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify potential patterns.\n",
    "   - Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.\n",
    "   - Encode categorical variables and standardize numerical features as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Development:**\n",
    "   - Experiment with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n",
    "   - Utilize techniques like cross-validation and grid search to optimize model hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate models using performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).\n",
    "   - Assess model robustness through cross-validation and examine the confusion matrix to understand classification errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Interpretation and Deployment:**\n",
    "   - Interpret model coefficients and feature importances to gain insights into the factors influencing classification.\n",
    "   - Deploy the final model in a healthcare setting, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems and adherence to regulatory standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries:\n",
    "- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)\n",
    "- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing the classification task outlined above, this project aims to provide a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, aiding in the early detection of fetal distress and ultimately contributing to the overarching goal of reducing child and maternal mortality worldwide.\n"
